Create your first mdx page and tag it add `home: true` in the frontmatter for the first page you'd like to render

Example:

```md

title: Getting started
home: true

```

To customise the sidebar, create a file at this path in your repository:

```md
src/gatsby-theme-docs/sidebar.js
```

with the categories and slugs for the sidebar

```js
export default [
  {
    title: 'Guides',
    slugs: ['/guides/getting-started', '/guides/next-steps']
  },
  {
    title: 'Components',
    slugs: ['components/alert', '/components/button']
  }
]
```
